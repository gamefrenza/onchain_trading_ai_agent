From Grok 2:


To develop an onchain AI agent for trading using Cursor AI IDE, here are detailed prompts you can use within Cursor IDE to guide your development process:

1. Setup and Environment Configuration:
Prompt: "Configure the environment for onchain AI trading agent development. Install necessary libraries for blockchain interaction, AI model integration, and GUI development."
Details: 
Blockchain interaction: web3.py for Ethereum, or specific SDKs for other blockchains like Solana or Binance Smart Chain.
AI model integration: Libraries like scikit-learn, tensorflow, or pytorch for machine learning models.
GUI: Use tkinter for a basic setup or consider PyQt5 for more advanced UI development.
Example command: !pip install web3 scikit-learn PyQt5

2. Blockchain Data Access:
Prompt: "Create scripts to fetch real-time onchain trading data. Use blockchain node or API services."
Details:
Implement functions to connect to blockchain nodes or APIs to retrieve transaction data, market data, or contract events.
Example: 
python
from web3 import Web3

w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('URL_OF_NODE'))
# Function to fetch latest transactions or events
def get_latest_transactions():
    # Implementation here
    pass

3. Data Analysis and Pattern Recognition:
Prompt: "Develop a module for quantitative analysis using historical onchain data. Use AI to identify trading patterns."
Details:
Implement algorithms for technical analysis (like moving averages, RSI) alongside machine learning models for pattern recognition.
Example:
python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

def analyze_patterns(data):
    # Data preprocessing
    # Model training and prediction
    model = RandomForestClassifier()
    # Fit the model with historical data
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    # Predict patterns
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    return predictions

4. Strategy Development:
Prompt: "Create a strategy module that uses AI predictions to formulate trading strategies."
Details:
Develop logic to convert pattern recognition into buy/sell signals.
Example:
python
def generate_strategy(predictions):
    strategy = []
    for prediction in predictions:
        if prediction == 'BUY': strategy.append('buy')
        elif prediction == 'SELL': strategy.append('sell')
        else: strategy.append('hold')
    return strategy

5. Automated Trading Execution:
Prompt: "Implement an execution module for automatic trade execution based on AI-generated strategies."
Details:
Use the blockchain SDK to send transactions based on strategy signals.
Example:
python
def execute_trade(strategy, wallet_address, private_key):
    if strategy == 'buy':
        # Implement buying logic
        pass
    elif strategy == 'sell':
        # Implement selling logic
        pass

6. User Interface Development:
Prompt: "Build a UI with PyQt5 to monitor AI agent activities, show real-time data, and allow for manual trade execution and interruption."
Details:
Design windows for displaying current market data, agent performance, and allowing manual input for trades.
Example:
python
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QPushButton

class TradingUI(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.initUI()

    def initUI(self):
        btn = QPushButton('Manual Trade', self)
        btn.clicked.connect(self.showDialog)
        self.setGeometry(300, 300, 300, 200)
        self.setWindowTitle('AI Trading Agent UI')
        self.show()

    def showDialog(self):
        # Implement dialog for manual trade execution
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    ex = TradingUI()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())

7. Integration and Testing:
Prompt: "Integrate all modules and set up tests for functionality and performance."
Details:
Ensure all components work together seamlessly. Write unit tests for each module and integration tests for the system.

8. Deployment and Monitoring:
Prompt: "Prepare for deployment and setup monitoring tools for the AI agent."
Details:
Consider containerization with Docker for consistent deployment environments.
Use tools like Prometheus or Grafana for monitoring agent and system performance.

These prompts should guide you through the process in Cursor AI IDE, leveraging its AI 
capabilities for code suggestions and auto-completion to make development more efficient.
Remember, you'll need to adapt these prompts based on the specific blockchain you're interacting with 
and the complexity of the AI models you choose to implement.
